This project is the org.openjfx fxml maven archetype (version 0.3)

It is more cleanly put together than the similar HelloFX project.

Both separate the java files and the resource files (fxml and css) and use FXML files linked with a controller class, with the main App class simply assembling and launching the Stage.
