This project is the an fxml maven archetype from ca.dsolutions (version 1.0)

It is a bit messier than the org.openjfx archetype of similar structure, but includes additional separation of the resources into fxml and css folders

Both separate the java files and the resource files (fxml and css) and use FXML files linked with a controller class, with the main App class simply assembling and launching the Stage.
